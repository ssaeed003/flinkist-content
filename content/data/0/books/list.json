              "Michelle Obama`s journey starts with “Becoming me”, a process of self-discovery and growth that she has experienced throughout her life. In her own words she expresses, \"Becoming isn't about arriving somewhere or achieving a certain aim. It's about the process of getting there.\"\n\nGrowing up in a working-class family on the South Side of Chicago, she was taught to be deferential and to put others' needs before her own. So it was tough for her and she struggled to find her own voice. However, as she began to navigate the world and find her place in it, she realized that she needed to speak up for herself and assert her own wants and needs.\n\nFor instance, when Michelle began her second grade year, she found herself in a classroom of complete chaos. With an overwhelmed teacher, she hardly had an opportunity to learn and it was clear that she was not the only one who was struggling.\n\nFortunately, she dared to express her displeasure to her mom and soon enough, she was tested and placed in a third grade class with other kids who were just as enthusiastic about learning. This was a much better fit for Michelle and she was able to thrive in her new environment and got into the Whitney M. Young High School.\n\nHowever she did not always have the feeling to fit in as she shares in another transformative memory from her youth, where she grappled with her identity and a sense of not belonging. Where she grew up, she stood out as one of the only Black students in her school, and felt disconnected from her peers due to differing cultural experiences.\n\nAs she walked home from class one day, she stumbled upon a group of girls playing Double Dutch, a game that involves jumping rope with two ropes. Envious of their laughter and joy, she mustered up the courage to ask if she could join in, despite feeling like an outsider. The girls welcomed her with open arms, and soon enough, she was jumping and laughing alongside them.\n\nThis moment marked a pivotal change for Michelle, as she realized that despite feeling different, she could still find a place and make connections. Through this experience, she came to appreciate the beauty in diversity and it helped her to understand that everyone struggles with feeling like they fit in at some point in their lives. This powerful anecdote serves as an inspiration to be brave and reach out to connect with others, even when it may feel daunting. \n\nAs she rose through the ranks in her career, first as a lawyer and then as the First Lady of the United States, she faced a number of challenges, including sexism, racism, and public scrutiny. Throughout it all, she had to learn to trust her own instincts and to push through the doubts and insecurities that threatened to hold her back.\"I had to learn to trust my own voice and to use it confidently and consistently, even when it meant going against the grain of what others expected of me.\"\n\nUltimately, \"Becoming Me\" is about embracing one's own imperfections and using them as a source of strength. As Michelle writes, \"I've learned that there is no one way to become. We all have to find our own journeys, and that's okay.\" By sharing the anecdotes and emotions of her  own story, she hopes to inspire others to find the courage to do the same."

              "After \"Becoming Me\"  the memoirs continue with the concept of \"Becoming Us\" which centers around the importance of community and the impact that the people around us have on shaping our identities. She writes, \"I've come to believe that the most important thing any of us can strive for is to be true to ourselves—to be the best version of ourselves—and in order to do that, we need to surround ourselves with people who will help us stay honest and grounded.\"\n\nOne key aspect of \"Becoming Us\" that Michelle emphasizes is the importance of vulnerability and openness in relationships. Sharing her own struggles and insecurities with her husband, Barack, allowed them to build a deeper and more meaningful connection. Being vulnerable with him helped her to become more comfortable with herself, to feel safe and more willing to take risks.\n\nOne incident showcases the resilience of her and Barrack's marriage in particular. A time when they were in their early thirties, trying to balance their demanding careers, parenting, and their relationship. The pressure was mounting and they were feeling the strain on their marriage.\n\nBut one night, after a particularly grueling day, Michelle came home to find her husband, Barack, sitting on the couch with a terrible look of exhaustion on his face. Instead of lashing out, they decided to take a different approach. They put on their shoes and went for a walk.\n\nAs they strolled through their neighborhood, they opened up to each other about their worries, their struggles and their aspirations. They laughed, they cried and they held hands. This simple act of walking and talking together was a turning point for them. They realized that in order to become better together, they had to make time for each other and for their relationship.\n\nThis experience taught them the power of communication and connection in a relationship. It taught them that it's okay to take a step back from the chaos of life and focus on what's truly important. It helped them to build a stronger bond and to become better partners in their marriage. This anecdote is a powerful reminder that in order to become the best versions of ourselves, we must actively work on maintaining healthy relationships.\n\n \"Becoming Us\" is also about the role of community in shaping our identities. Obama remembers how her experiences with her early surroundings helped shape her values and her understanding of the world. She says, \"I came of age in a community that was full of strong, driven people who were determined to make something of themselves and of the world around them.\"\n\nOne of these people was her father, Fraser Robinson III, a working-class man who lived with multiple sclerosis but never let his illness define him. Despite his challenges, he never missed a day of work and he always placed his family first.\n\nOne day, Michelle came home from school and found her father sitting in his favorite chair, looking defeated. He told her that he had been laid off from his job, and he didn't know how they were going to make ends meet. Michelle was only a child at the time, but she could sense her father's worry and disappointment.\n\nHowever, instead of dwelling on the situation, her father rallied his family together. He started his own business and worked tirelessly to provide for his family. Despite the long hours and hard work, he never lost his sense of humor or his positive attitude. Michelle`s father was it, who really  taught her the value of hard work and perseverance in the face of adversity.\n\nHe taught her to never give up, to always put the family first, and to approach challenges with a positive attitude. These values have shaped who Michelle is today and have served her well throughout her life and career.\n\nNext to her parents various teachers and mentors influenced her throughout her life and helped shape who she is. Expressing a lot of gratitude she highlights the impact of mentorship and the importance of having role models who can guide and inspire us. She encourages us to seek out our mentors and to pay it forward by being a mentor to others.\n\nEmbracing vulnerability, building meaningful relationships, and surrounding ourselves with a supportive community. Through sharing her own personal stories and reflections, she illustrates the powerful impact that the people around us can have on shaping our identities and becoming the best versions of ourselves."

              "Aligned with her values, Michelle forms the concept of \"Becoming More\". This concept is about pushing oneself to grow and evolve, both personally and as a member of society.\n\nAs the First Lady, she had a platform and a voice, but she often felt constrained by the expectations and limitations placed upon her. She writes about a specific instance where she found the courage to break out of her comfort zone and speak out on a controversial issue.\n\nOne day, while visiting a school, she was approached by a student who asked her a difficult question about gender equality and the pay gap between men and women. In that moment, Michelle could have given a safe and politically correct answer, but something inside her stirred. With a newfound sense of conviction, she spoke candidly about her own experiences and the systemic barriers that women still face in the workforce.\n\nThis instance was a turning point. She realized that she had the power to use her platform to spark meaningful conversations and effect change. This experience taught her to embrace her voice and speak up for what she believed in, no matter the challenges or backlash she might face. This powerful anecdote serves as a reminder that every individual has the capacity to become more, to challenge their own limits, and to make a difference in the world.\n\nOne step to unleash that power is embracing imperfection. One day, Michelle's mother came to visit her in Washington D.C., and Michelle decided to take her on a tour of the city. They walked around the monuments and visited museums, and as they were walking, Michelle's mother suddenly stopped and pointed to a statue of a young girl. Michelle's mother explained that the statue represented the idea of letting go of perfection and embracing the imperfections that make us who we are.\n\nThis simple moment of wisdom from her mother changed her life. She realized that she had been so focused on trying to be perfect that she had forgotten to enjoy the journey. She also realized that by letting go of her perfectionism, she could become a better, more authentic version of herself. She learned to embrace her flaws and to focus on growth and self-improvement instead of perfection.\n\nThe powerful message that Michelle learned from her mother about the importance of letting go of perfectionism and embracing our imperfections serves as an inspiration for anyone who feels like they are constantly trying to be perfect, and it reminds us that we can all grow and become better by accepting who we are with all our imperfections. She remembers: \"I had to learn to let go of my need for control and perfection, and to embrace the messiness of life. I had to understand that vulnerability is not weakness; it's our greatest measure of courage.\" This idea of vulnerability is something that Obama herself grappled with, as she admits to having \"spent most of my life trying to avoid being vulnerable.\"\n\nAnother aspect of \"Becoming More\" is the idea of using one's platform and privilege for good. Obama reflects on her time as First Lady and the impact she was able to make through her initiatives, such as Let's Move! and Reach Higher. She writes, \"I came to understand that my own story – of becoming, of finding my voice and my purpose – was a story that could be useful to others.\" So she decided to share her journey and encourages everyone to to use their individual experiences and struggles to make a difference in the world and in the lives of others. As Obama writes, \"We all have the power to shape our own stories, and it's up to us to use that power to create something meaningful.\""

              "Michelle Obama has lived a life filled with determination, being ambitious in everything she does, whether it be as a student, professional, mother or First Lady. Over time, she learned to understand herself better and pursue her own goals, rather than trying to meet societal expectations. Michelle became a strong and independent woman, a working mother who could support her family and her community. Despite her many achievements, she never stops working towards helping others.\n\nReflecting on her time in the White House, Michelle is proud of her many successes, such as the Let's Move! program, which provided healthier meals to 45 million students and after-school programs for 11 million children. Her Joining Forces initiative helped 1.5 million veterans and their spouses find jobs, while her Let Girls Learn initiative raised billions of dollars to give girls around the world access to education. But, for Michelle, her greatest accomplishment is raising two wonderful daughters, despite the demanding public office she held alongside her husband.\n\nIn a particularly powerful passage, she tells us, \"When we commit to a journey of becoming, we commit to a life of constant growth and change. It's not always easy, but it is always worth it.\" She encourages us to embrace the challenges and uncertainty that come with the process of becoming and to trust in the power of personal growth. In the end, she leaves us with a sense of empowerment and inspiration, to embark on our own journey of self-discovery and growth, and to always strive to become the best versions of ourselves.\n\nHere are ten actions you can take to implement the learnings from the book into your life:\n\n1.\n\nPrioritize self-care and self-discovery.

                "\"Passion and Perseverance\" are the two key components of grit, according to Angela Duckworth. She delves deeper into these two elements and explains how they work together to drive success.\n\nDuckworth shows us that passion can be defined as a long-term commitment to a particular goal or field of interest, and explains that it is this commitment that provides the drive and motivation needed to keep pushing forward, even when faced with obstacles and setbacks. She notes positive emotions, often accompany that passion such as excitement, joy, and a sense of purpose.\n\nPerseverance is the unwavering determination to keep working towards an objective, even in the face of adversity. Angela notes negative emotions often accompany that perseverance, such as frustration, anger, and disappointment. However, she argues it is this ability to persist in the face of difficulties that sets grit apart from other personality traits and allows us to achieve our goals.\n\nTo give us an idea, Angela shares several inspiring examples of individuals who embody both passion and perseverance. For example, she describes the story of a West Point cadet who was told he was too small to be an effective soldier, but who refused to quit on his dream and became one of the top cadets in his class.\n\nShe also cites a wealth of research to support her theory of grit, including studies that have found that individuals who score high in grit are more likely to succeed in school, the military, and a variety of other pursuits.\n\n\"Passion and Perseverance\" is a powerful reminder that success is not just about talent or IQ, but about a combination of drive, determination, and the ability to persist in the face of adversity. By embracing the principles of passion and perseverance, we can all tap into our inner grit and achieve great things."

She notes that individuals who are high in grit tend to be more resilient, optimistic, and have a greater sense of purpose than those who are low in grit.\n\nOne of the important characteristics of grit for Duckworth, is a strong sense of purpose. She explains that individuals who are high in grit clearly understand their goals and the reasons they are pursuing them.

For example, Angela recommends exploring different interests, trying new things, and seeking opportunities to learn and grow.\n\nWe’re reminded of the importance of pursuing our passions and the role that interests play in developing and maintaining grit as seen in Angela’s work."

                  "Overcoming adversity is a central theme in Angela Duckworth's book. The evidence and practical strategies provided by Angela show us how individuals can overcome adversity and maintain their grit in the face of challenges and obstacles.\n\nTo begin, Angela explores the idea that adversity can be a powerful tool for building grit. She notes that individuals who have faced and overcome adversity often develop greater resilience and determination, which can help them become even more gritty.\n\nAngela shares several insightful examples of individuals who have overcome adversity and achieved great success. For example, she describes the story of a young woman who faced various challenges and obstacles, including poverty and discrimination, on her path to becoming a successful business leader.\n\nIn addition to her heartening stories, Duckworth also provides scientific evidence to support the idea that overcoming adversity can build grit. For example, she cites research that has found that individuals who have faced and overcome adversity are more resilient and better equipped to handle future challenges.\n\nTo help individuals overcome adversity, Angela provides several practical strategies. For example, she recommends developing a growth mindset, focusing on what she can learn from failure, and seeking supportive relationships and networks.\n\n\"Overcoming Adversity\" is another example of the importance of persevering through tough times, and of how adversity can actually help individuals to build grit and achieve their goals. By embracing challenges and viewing them as opportunities for growth, we can develop the grit that we need to overcome adversity."

                  "In \"Grit\" by Angela Duckworth, the seventh key idea focuses on \"Building Grit in Children\". The author presents evidence, anecdotes, and examples to explain the importance of fostering grit in young individuals and how it can be developed.\n\nAngela emphasizes one of her noteworthy points that are parents and teachers and how they play a crucial role in shaping a child's mindset and values. For instance, she stresses the significance of teaching children that effort, complicated work, and perseverance are essential to succeed in life. Children should be encouraged to embrace challenges and obstacles as opportunities to grow and develop.\n\nAnother important aspect of building grit in children is helping them find their passions. By providing a supportive environment, children can explore their interests, develop their skills, and discover what they are truly passionate about.\n\nDuckworth highlights the importance of setting goals and establishing purpose in a child's life. We should teach children to set both short-term and long-term goals and work towards achieving them. This helps them understand the significance of their actions and fosters a sense of purpose.\n\nFinally, building resilience is an integral part of developing grit in children. We should teach children how to overcome adversity and handle disappointment and failure with grace. This will help them build resilience and the ability to bounce back from setbacks in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, building grit in children requires a combination of fostering a growth mindset, promoting passion and purpose, and teaching resilience. By focusing on these key aspects, parents and teachers can help children develop the grit they need to succeed in life."

According to Duckworth, adult life presents unique challenges that can often test one's grit and resilience.\n\nShe cites examples of successful individuals who have honed their grit later in life, including: a teacher who pursued her PhD in her 60s, a veteran who became a successful businessman after leaving the military, and a doctor who changed careers and started his own medical practice in his 40s.\n\nTo cultivate grit in adulthood, Duckworth suggests finding new passions and interests that align with one's values and developing a growth mindset, which is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through complicated work and dedication. She also suggests pursuing long-term goals and surrounding oneself with supportive individuals who share similar values and beliefs.\n\nDeveloping your grit in adulthood requires embracing change, embracing challenges, and viewing setbacks as opportunities to learn and grow. With a steadfast commitment and the right mindset, anyone can cultivate grit and achieve their life goals, no matter what stage of life they are in."
