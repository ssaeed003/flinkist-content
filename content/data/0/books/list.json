              "Michelle Obama`s journey starts with “Becoming me”, a process of self-discovery and growth that she has experienced throughout her life. In her own words she expresses, \"Becoming isn't about arriving somewhere or achieving a certain aim. It's about the process of getting there.\"\n\nGrowing up in a working-class family on the South Side of Chicago, she was taught to be deferential and to put others' needs before her own. So it was tough for her and she struggled to find her own voice. However, as she began to navigate the world and find her place in it, she realized that she needed to speak up for herself and assert her own wants and needs.\n\nFor instance, when Michelle began her second grade year, she found herself in a classroom of complete chaos. With an overwhelmed teacher, she hardly had an opportunity to learn and it was clear that she was not the only one who was struggling.\n\nFortunately, she dared to express her displeasure to her mom and soon enough, she was tested and placed in a third grade class with other kids who were just as enthusiastic about learning. This was a much better fit for Michelle and she was able to thrive in her new environment and got into the Whitney M. Young High School.\n\nHowever she did not always have the feeling to fit in as she shares in another transformative memory from her youth, where she grappled with her identity and a sense of not belonging. Where she grew up, she stood out as one of the only Black students in her school, and felt disconnected from her peers due to differing cultural experiences.\n\nAs she walked home from class one day, she stumbled upon a group of girls playing Double Dutch, a game that involves jumping rope with two ropes. Envious of their laughter and joy, she mustered up the courage to ask if she could join in, despite feeling like an outsider. The girls welcomed her with open arms, and soon enough, she was jumping and laughing alongside them.\n\nThis moment marked a pivotal change for Michelle, as she realized that despite feeling different, she could still find a place and make connections. Through this experience, she came to appreciate the beauty in diversity and it helped her to understand that everyone struggles with feeling like they fit in at some point in their lives. This powerful anecdote serves as an inspiration to be brave and reach out to connect with others, even when it may feel daunting. \n\nAs she rose through the ranks in her career, first as a lawyer and then as the First Lady of the United States, she faced a number of challenges, including sexism, racism, and public scrutiny. Throughout it all, she had to learn to trust her own instincts and to push through the doubts and insecurities that threatened to hold her back.\"I had to learn to trust my own voice and to use it confidently and consistently, even when it meant going against the grain of what others expected of me.\"\n\nUltimately, \"Becoming Me\" is about embracing one's own imperfections and using them as a source of strength. As Michelle writes, \"I've learned that there is no one way to become. We all have to find our own journeys, and that's okay.\" By sharing the anecdotes and emotions of her  own story, she hopes to inspire others to find the courage to do the same."

              "After \"Becoming Me\"  the memoirs continue with the concept of \"Becoming Us\" which centers around the importance of community and the impact that the people around us have on shaping our identities. She writes, \"I've come to believe that the most important thing any of us can strive for is to be true to ourselves—to be the best version of ourselves—and in order to do that, we need to surround ourselves with people who will help us stay honest and grounded.\"\n\nOne key aspect of \"Becoming Us\" that Michelle emphasizes is the importance of vulnerability and openness in relationships. Sharing her own struggles and insecurities with her husband, Barack, allowed them to build a deeper and more meaningful connection. Being vulnerable with him helped her to become more comfortable with herself, to feel safe and more willing to take risks.\n\nOne incident showcases the resilience of her and Barrack's marriage in particular. A time when they were in their early thirties, trying to balance their demanding careers, parenting, and their relationship. The pressure was mounting and they were feeling the strain on their marriage.\n\nBut one night, after a particularly grueling day, Michelle came home to find her husband, Barack, sitting on the couch with a terrible look of exhaustion on his face. Instead of lashing out, they decided to take a different approach. They put on their shoes and went for a walk.\n\nAs they strolled through their neighborhood, they opened up to each other about their worries, their struggles and their aspirations. They laughed, they cried and they held hands. This simple act of walking and talking together was a turning point for them. They realized that in order to become better together, they had to make time for each other and for their relationship.\n\nThis experience taught them the power of communication and connection in a relationship. It taught them that it's okay to take a step back from the chaos of life and focus on what's truly important. It helped them to build a stronger bond and to become better partners in their marriage. This anecdote is a powerful reminder that in order to become the best versions of ourselves, we must actively work on maintaining healthy relationships.\n\n \"Becoming Us\" is also about the role of community in shaping our identities. Obama remembers how her experiences with her early surroundings helped shape her values and her understanding of the world. She says, \"I came of age in a community that was full of strong, driven people who were determined to make something of themselves and of the world around them.\"\n\nOne of these people was her father, Fraser Robinson III, a working-class man who lived with multiple sclerosis but never let his illness define him. Despite his challenges, he never missed a day of work and he always placed his family first.\n\nOne day, Michelle came home from school and found her father sitting in his favorite chair, looking defeated. He told her that he had been laid off from his job, and he didn't know how they were going to make ends meet. Michelle was only a child at the time, but she could sense her father's worry and disappointment.\n\nHowever, instead of dwelling on the situation, her father rallied his family together. He started his own business and worked tirelessly to provide for his family. Despite the long hours and hard work, he never lost his sense of humor or his positive attitude. Michelle`s father was it, who really  taught her the value of hard work and perseverance in the face of adversity.\n\nHe taught her to never give up, to always put the family first, and to approach challenges with a positive attitude. These values have shaped who Michelle is today and have served her well throughout her life and career.\n\nNext to her parents various teachers and mentors influenced her throughout her life and helped shape who she is. Expressing a lot of gratitude she highlights the impact of mentorship and the importance of having role models who can guide and inspire us. She encourages us to seek out our mentors and to pay it forward by being a mentor to others.\n\nEmbracing vulnerability, building meaningful relationships, and surrounding ourselves with a supportive community. Through sharing her own personal stories and reflections, she illustrates the powerful impact that the people around us can have on shaping our identities and becoming the best versions of ourselves."

              "Aligned with her values, Michelle forms the concept of \"Becoming More\". This concept is about pushing oneself to grow and evolve, both personally and as a member of society.\n\nAs the First Lady, she had a platform and a voice, but she often felt constrained by the expectations and limitations placed upon her. She writes about a specific instance where she found the courage to break out of her comfort zone and speak out on a controversial issue.\n\nOne day, while visiting a school, she was approached by a student who asked her a difficult question about gender equality and the pay gap between men and women. In that moment, Michelle could have given a safe and politically correct answer, but something inside her stirred. With a newfound sense of conviction, she spoke candidly about her own experiences and the systemic barriers that women still face in the workforce.\n\nThis instance was a turning point. She realized that she had the power to use her platform to spark meaningful conversations and effect change. This experience taught her to embrace her voice and speak up for what she believed in, no matter the challenges or backlash she might face. This powerful anecdote serves as a reminder that every individual has the capacity to become more, to challenge their own limits, and to make a difference in the world.\n\nOne step to unleash that power is embracing imperfection. One day, Michelle's mother came to visit her in Washington D.C., and Michelle decided to take her on a tour of the city. They walked around the monuments and visited museums, and as they were walking, Michelle's mother suddenly stopped and pointed to a statue of a young girl. Michelle's mother explained that the statue represented the idea of letting go of perfection and embracing the imperfections that make us who we are.\n\nThis simple moment of wisdom from her mother changed her life. She realized that she had been so focused on trying to be perfect that she had forgotten to enjoy the journey. She also realized that by letting go of her perfectionism, she could become a better, more authentic version of herself. She learned to embrace her flaws and to focus on growth and self-improvement instead of perfection.\n\nThe powerful message that Michelle learned from her mother about the importance of letting go of perfectionism and embracing our imperfections serves as an inspiration for anyone who feels like they are constantly trying to be perfect, and it reminds us that we can all grow and become better by accepting who we are with all our imperfections. She remembers: \"I had to learn to let go of my need for control and perfection, and to embrace the messiness of life. I had to understand that vulnerability is not weakness; it's our greatest measure of courage.\" This idea of vulnerability is something that Obama herself grappled with, as she admits to having \"spent most of my life trying to avoid being vulnerable.\"\n\nAnother aspect of \"Becoming More\" is the idea of using one's platform and privilege for good. Obama reflects on her time as First Lady and the impact she was able to make through her initiatives, such as Let's Move! and Reach Higher. She writes, \"I came to understand that my own story – of becoming, of finding my voice and my purpose – was a story that could be useful to others.\" So she decided to share her journey and encourages everyone to to use their individual experiences and struggles to make a difference in the world and in the lives of others. As Obama writes, \"We all have the power to shape our own stories, and it's up to us to use that power to create something meaningful.\""

              "Michelle Obama has lived a life filled with determination, being ambitious in everything she does, whether it be as a student, professional, mother or First Lady. Over time, she learned to understand herself better and pursue her own goals, rather than trying to meet societal expectations. Michelle became a strong and independent woman, a working mother who could support her family and her community. Despite her many achievements, she never stops working towards helping others.\n\nReflecting on her time in the White House, Michelle is proud of her many successes, such as the Let's Move! program, which provided healthier meals to 45 million students and after-school programs for 11 million children. Her Joining Forces initiative helped 1.5 million veterans and their spouses find jobs, while her Let Girls Learn initiative raised billions of dollars to give girls around the world access to education. But, for Michelle, her greatest accomplishment is raising two wonderful daughters, despite the demanding public office she held alongside her husband.\n\nIn a particularly powerful passage, she tells us, \"When we commit to a journey of becoming, we commit to a life of constant growth and change. It's not always easy, but it is always worth it.\" She encourages us to embrace the challenges and uncertainty that come with the process of becoming and to trust in the power of personal growth. In the end, she leaves us with a sense of empowerment and inspiration, to embark on our own journey of self-discovery and growth, and to always strive to become the best versions of ourselves.\n\nHere are ten actions you can take to implement the learnings from the book into your life:\n\n1.\n\nPrioritize self-care and self-discovery.

                "\"Passion and Perseverance\" are the two key components of grit, according to Angela Duckworth. She delves deeper into these two elements and explains how they work together to drive success.\n\nDuckworth shows us that passion can be defined as a long-term commitment to a particular goal or field of interest, and explains that it is this commitment that provides the drive and motivation needed to keep pushing forward, even when faced with obstacles and setbacks. She notes positive emotions, often accompany that passion such as excitement, joy, and a sense of purpose.\n\nPerseverance is the unwavering determination to keep working towards an objective, even in the face of adversity. Angela notes negative emotions often accompany that perseverance, such as frustration, anger, and disappointment. However, she argues it is this ability to persist in the face of difficulties that sets grit apart from other personality traits and allows us to achieve our goals.\n\nTo give us an idea, Angela shares several inspiring examples of individuals who embody both passion and perseverance. For example, she describes the story of a West Point cadet who was told he was too small to be an effective soldier, but who refused to quit on his dream and became one of the top cadets in his class.\n\nShe also cites a wealth of research to support her theory of grit, including studies that have found that individuals who score high in grit are more likely to succeed in school, the military, and a variety of other pursuits.\n\n\"Passion and Perseverance\" is a powerful reminder that success is not just about talent or IQ, but about a combination of drive, determination, and the ability to persist in the face of adversity. By embracing the principles of passion and perseverance, we can all tap into our inner grit and achieve great things."

                  "Overcoming adversity is a central theme in Angela Duckworth's book. The evidence and practical strategies provided by Angela show us how individuals can overcome adversity and maintain their grit in the face of challenges and obstacles.\n\nTo begin, Angela explores the idea that adversity can be a powerful tool for building grit. She notes that individuals who have faced and overcome adversity often develop greater resilience and determination, which can help them become even more gritty.\n\nAngela shares several insightful examples of individuals who have overcome adversity and achieved great success. For example, she describes the story of a young woman who faced various challenges and obstacles, including poverty and discrimination, on her path to becoming a successful business leader.\n\nIn addition to her heartening stories, Duckworth also provides scientific evidence to support the idea that overcoming adversity can build grit. For example, she cites research that has found that individuals who have faced and overcome adversity are more resilient and better equipped to handle future challenges.\n\nTo help individuals overcome adversity, Angela provides several practical strategies. For example, she recommends developing a growth mindset, focusing on what she can learn from failure, and seeking supportive relationships and networks.\n\n\"Overcoming Adversity\" is another example of the importance of persevering through tough times, and of how adversity can actually help individuals to build grit and achieve their goals. By embracing challenges and viewing them as opportunities for growth, we can develop the grit that we need to overcome adversity."

The author presents evidence, anecdotes, and examples to explain the importance of fostering grit in young individuals and how it can be developed.\n\nAngela emphasizes one of her noteworthy points that are parents and teachers and how they play a crucial role in shaping a child's mindset and values. For instance, she stresses the significance of teaching children that effort, complicated work, and perseverance are essential to succeed in life. Children should be encouraged to embrace challenges and obstacles as opportunities to grow and develop.\n\nAnother important aspect of building grit in children is helping them find their passions. By providing a supportive environment, children can explore their interests, develop their skills, and discover what they are truly passionate about.\n\nDuckworth highlights the importance of setting goals and establishing purpose in a child's life. We should teach children to set both short-term and long-term goals and work towards achieving them. This helps them understand the significance of their actions and fosters a sense of purpose.\n\nFinally, building resilience is an integral part of developing grit in children. We should teach children how to overcome adversity and handle disappointment and failure with grace. This will help them build resilience and the ability to bounce back from setbacks in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, building grit in children requires a combination of fostering a growth mindset, promoting passion and purpose, and teaching resilience. By focusing on these key aspects, parents and teachers can help children develop the grit they need to succeed in life."

She also suggests pursuing long-term goals and surrounding oneself with supportive individuals who share similar values and beliefs.\n\nDeveloping your grit in adulthood requires embracing change, embracing challenges, and viewing setbacks as opportunities to learn and grow.

                "Having a healthy work-life balance is a goal for many of us. It's possible that we'll assume this means prioritizing each aspect of our life equally. However, that can't be correct. If everything in our life were in harmony, we wouldn't be making any progress; rather, we'd be spinning our wheels aimlessly. Don't waste your time trying to strike a balance; instead, pay attention to what matters most. If you've ever tried to ride a bike while standing motionless, you know how difficult it is to keep your balance. Get going by leaning forward slightly and pedaling slowly. Then, you have to adjust your center of gravity whether you want to make a left or right turn. However, if you lean too much in one direction, you'll fall over. To keep the bike balanced, you must constantly shift your weight. Progress, then, need for undivided attention and a steady dose of balancing force.\n\nThe same holds true for our own life; it's not enough to just seek equilibrium. To start things rolling, we need to zero in on our top priorities. To keep going, we must continuously reallocate resources to meet competing demands. nLet's investigate the causes of our difficulty concentrating. A person's life consists of three distinct parts: professional, private, and domestic. Our jobs, whether they be at home or in the workplace, are an integral part of our daily lives. Our personal lives include the people and activities in which we engage, as well as our aspirations, interests, and physical and mental well-being. The majority of our free time is taken up by the myriad of chores and errands necessary to maintain our daily routines.\n\nEach of these facets deserves our attention. However, we can't provide equal attention to each of them at the same time. Spreading these three limited resources too thin over all aspects of life leads to a lot of wasted time and energy with little to show for it. Then, what's the point? Well, many of us strive for the \"ideal\" balance because we believe that is what society wants of us. We must, however, release ourselves from such idealistic paralysis.\n\nFirst, the expectations must be recognized; next, they must be abandoned. For instance, the author used to think that mothers who stayed at home, made homemade treats for their children, and volunteered frequently at their children's schools exemplified the ideal of a good mother. It was difficult for her to reach these standards since, although enjoying her work, her schedule prevented her from doing so. Just trying to get everything done exhausted her and left her feeling unsatisfied. However, over time, she revised her standards to include those mothers who genuinely cared for their children.\n\nThe author attributes her current state of contentment to her decision to reject the unreasonable expectations, at which point she stopped attempting to strike a balance and began to focus."

                "Each day, we engage in several decision-making processes. However, few of us actually stop to consider the factors that influence our choices. Just following in the footsteps of others? Have you yet settled on a personal mission that you intend to follow?\n\nIn order to set priorities and make sound judgments, it is essential to have a crystal-clear reason for doing anything. Despite initial concerns, the time and energy spent on its creation are well compensated. The essential point is that your choices in life will be influenced by the meaning you give to your existence. You may define your purpose by bringing together your mission, vision, and values. Let's examine the meaning of these components individually.\n\nFirst, figure out what it is you're trying to do. To do this, use the ABC Brain Dump method. Put the alphabetic characters down on paper first. Take a few moments and reflect about your motivations. List anything that comes to mind, alphabetically, from A to Z. When you're finished, you'll have a total of 26 items to check off. Use the most prominent ideas and words that keep coming up as the basis for your goal statement. A well-crafted mission statement is one that captures the essence of your organization in a few memorable sentences. Example: Nike's stated goal is \"to deliver inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the globe.\" It's interesting that their stated purpose doesn't specify what it is that Nike produces. The emphasis is instead placed on the characters' motivations.\n\nNext, let's create a vision statement that lays out your long-term objectives. Use a vision board to help you make one. Make a motivational poster by pasting magazine clippings with encouraging quotes and photos onto a piece of cardboard. Consider some questions such, \"How do I want to develop and change in the future?\" when you do this. Where may I find improvement opportunities in the work that I am currently doing? Imagine the best possible future by answering these questions and looking at the motivational quotes and photos on your board. Transform this into a snappy, easy-to-remember sentence.\n\nIn closing, consider the concept of fundamental principles. We are guided and shaped by these words. Describe yourself in the absence of others using the words you have written down. Your set of essential values should consist of no more than six words at most. If your list is more than six words, consider grouping terms that have similar meanings together, and then pick the one term that best summarizes everything. Adobe's fundamental values—performance, passion, integrity, and diversity—serve as an excellent case in point. It may take some time, but after you've settled on your goal, vision, and values, you'll have a clear sense of direction."

                "In today's world of constant distractions from our cellphones, the beeps of emails, the allure of social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, and the endless opportunities for mindless web browsing, it's a miracle that we can get anything done at all. But to truly be productive, it's essential to ignore the trivialities that take up our time and concentrate on what truly matters.\n\nOne way to increase your focus is by establishing clear goals and limits. A study of Harvard Business School (HBS) students conducted just before they graduated found that a mere 3% of students had written down their goals and devised a plan to achieve them, while 13% had some written goals, but no plan, and 84% had no written goals at all. 10 years later, researchers found that the students who had written down their goals and devised a plan to reach them were making 10 times as much as the remaining 97%, and twice as much as the students who had no written goals at all.\n\nWriting down your goals and having a plan to achieve them is a highly effective way to increase your focus, but it's not the only way. Another important aspect of maintaining focus is to establish strict limits. These limits grant us more independence by giving us sufficient time to devote to each aspect of our lives, whether it's work, family, or something else.\n\nFor example, if you find yourself constantly checking your email outside of business hours, it might be helpful to schedule specific intervals during which you check your work email, and to set definite beginning and ending times. This way, you're not leaving it open-ended, and you can use the rest of your time to focus on other things. Similarly, if you find yourself spending a significant portion of your workday talking to loved ones, it may be necessary to suggest they call back later so you can devote more time to your work. In conclusion, to increase your focus and be more productive, it's essential to ignore the distractions of our modern world and concentrate on what truly matters. Establishing clear goals and limits is an effective way to achieve this, and it allows you to make the most of your time, both professionally and personally."

                  "Many people strive for personal and professional productivity. Productivity is misinterpreted. Some individuals think they're productive if they finish a lot of work quickly, but this isn't always true. Effective productivity requires prioritizing your tasks.\n\nProductivity requires prioritizing goals over deadlines, quality over quantity, and the future over the present. Effectiveness requires prioritizing what matters most. Dispelling the three productivity misconceptions that limit focus and encourage overwork is crucial to this.\n\nMultitasking is the first productivity myth. Many of us pride ourselves on multitasking, yet the brain is intended to do one thing at a time. Multitasking reduces productivity by 40%, according to research. A University of London study indicated that multitasking lowers IQs to the same amount as not sleeping or using marijuana. Multitasking slows us and lowers work quality.\n\nThe second productivity myth is that we don't have time for breaks. False. Our biological ultradian rhythm requires a 20-minute respite every 90 to 120 minutes. Continuous work exhausts the brain. In 1914, Henry Ford doubled his workers' wages and decreased shifts from nine to eight, demonstrating this idea. Despite criticism and derision, his competition mimicked his enhanced output.\n\nTechnology usually improves productivity, the third misconception. Technology makes life easier, but it doesn't always work well. Writing thoughts and plans by hand is more successful than typing them on a computer, according to study. Handwriting activates the reticular activating system, which alerts and stores information. Thus, occasionally closing the laptop and writing ideas by hand is advised.\n\nBy dispelling these three fallacies and prioritizing, we may remind ourselves that not all tasks are equal. Warren Buffet, for example, credits 90% of his wealth to 10% of his enterprises. Focusing on less can lead to more.\n\nMany of us feel overwhelmed by to-do lists. It's usually not too much to do but where to start. Prioritizing helps. Escalate, Cultivate, and Accommodate are priority levels. Escalate duties include car repairs and last-minute project changes after supervisor input. Prioritize these tasks. Long-term projects and budget planning are on the Cultivate level. This level requires the most energy and lets us be proactive and work well. The Accommodate level includes urgent but minor duties like phone calls or emails."

                  "Unfortunately, prioritizing isn't enough. Laundry, cleaning, and budgeting must also be managed. Managing this alongside other tasks can be difficult. Good systems help. Positive behaviors strengthen systems. Habits automate tasks. Develop good habits to build good systems. Despite being only 2% of our body mass, our brains use 20% of our daily calories! When overworked, the brain loses energy and decision-making abilities. Good routines liberate up brain resources to focus on what counts. How do you form excellent habits? First, describe the habit. Why do I want a new habit? Say you want to become in shape. Find the prompts. These activate habits. Location, time, emotion, people, and action are cues. Leaving your footwear at the door could remind you to run after work. Define conduct. It takes 66 days to create a habit, so it helps to detect excuses like \"I'm too tired to go for a run\" early on. Tomorrow.” If you've forecast the excuse, you'll be ready to fight it. Finally, we must arrange for Record, Reward, and Redirect. When you start creating a habit, it's hard to detect improvement, so track it. Use a running app to track your runs. rewards. Brain study shows that rewards form habits. Rewards tell the brain to remember this behavior for later. Rewards are unnecessary after the habit is created. Redirect. You'll fall. A week without exercise is no excuse to quit! Just get up, recover, and refocus. Building good habits takes additional effort at first. Maintaining a system needs less effort, energy, and thought.\n\nRoutines—restrictive or liberating? Routines can enhance daily living, contrary to popular belief. Why? because they save time, brainpower, and effort. Automatic routines Consider your morning routine: brushing your teeth, showering, applying deodorant, etc. We can also tailor routines to our needs. It could be making time for something important. Routines minimize stress and improve life. Automated laundry procedures are especially beneficial. “It's Tuesday – laundry day!” the author called out weekly when her kids were three. Her kids didn't require instructions since this was a tradition. Each brought their clothing hamper into the main area. By five, they helped their mom sort laundry. The author considered this automatic procedure an investment. The youngsters washed their garments again a few years later. Both kids now wash their clothes and the family's bedsheets and towels. Training her children took time, but now she has more time for more vital activities. Automation can help manage large projects by breaking them down into smaller jobs throughout the year. We know taxes are due in April, but waiting until the last minute to organize our papers causes unnecessary stress. Why not create a folder with a checklist for all the papers in January? In February, file all appropriate documentation. Make a March accountant appointment. Relax in April. These automated routines let you be proactive and work your best. They ease your life."

                  "Can you tell me how often you take a break from your hectic schedule? It's not easy, but we should all try to carve out some time for rest and relaxation in order to recharge our batteries. Having some empty mental real estate is essential. The problem is that we become caught up in our routines to the point where we believe we have no time for anything else. So let me ask you another one: Have you spent the last year doing meaningless things like binge-watching TV or scrolling through your phone? If you said yes, then white space is available; you're simply not taking advantage of it. However, unlike many pleasant things, white space does not spontaneously materialize; rather, it must be crafted anew each time. The takeaway here is simple: if you want to get things done, you need to let your mind wander and toy about every once in a while.\n\nSelf-care is not an option; it's a requirement that we must meet. The key to improved efficiency, inspiration, and focus lies within it. The advantages of white space are not merely theoretical. It has been proved through studies to improve our problem-solving skills, resilience in the face of adversity, and intrinsic motivation. If we don't schedule downtime for ourselves, our minds will fill it with pointless activities like checking our phones and scrolling through social media. There must be better ways to spend the five years and four months the average person will spend on social media throughout their lifetime.\n\nSo, what is the most efficient method for creating empty space? Defining limits is straightforward. However, it's not just a matter of blocking off specific hours. Turning off our phones and putting off responding to emails are also part of this concept. The author and her closest friends' family decided to take a five-day vacation without any electronic devices, and during that time, she saw firsthand how much our reliance on screens has warped our daily lives. We are so engrossed in our electronic gadgets that we rarely look up to notice or engage with the world around us. Everyone remained up late, had meaningful conversations with one another, and found peace in the natural world because there were no screens to distract them.\n\nSelf-care is an investment with phenomenal rewards, therefore it's worth every minute we put into it."

              "Let's begin by imagining a jet taking off from Los Angeles. The flight is bound towards New York. The plane takes off in the right direction after the pilot inputs the correct coordinates into the navigation system. But let's say that shortly after liftoff, the pilot makes a little adjustment to the flight path. He makes a minor adjustment of only 3.5 degrees, which is equivalent to a distance of only a few feet. Everyone on board, including the pilot, is blissfully oblivious to the plane's subtle nosedive to one side. But this minor modification would have a significant effect over the course of a trip throughout the United States. The flight would conclude in Washington, DC, not New York City, leading to a number of puzzled passengers and an even more bewildered pilot.\n\nBut why am I revealing this to you?\n\nLike the befuddled pilot, we fail to see even subtle shifts in our circumstances. Minor adjustments have almost no noticeable effect right away. Even if you go for a 20-minute jog today, if you are out of shape right now, you will still be out of shape tomorrow. A family-sized pizza for dinner won't cause instant obesity. But if we keep doing these minor things over and over again, our cumulative decisions will have far-reaching consequences. If you eat pizza every day for a year, you will most likely be significantly heavier. You won't feel any different after 20 minutes of jogging per day, but with time you will become leaner and more physically fit. You've probably already gleaned the primary point: even seemingly innocuous habits can have far-reaching consequences over time, and it's not always easy to see how they're working. Only after a period of time have your behaviors begun to show.\n\nWe now understand that it is disheartening to work hard and have little to show for it. If you're going through this right now and becoming down on yourself because of the slow pace of progress, it may help to shift your attention from the outcomes you've achieved so far to the direction in which you're headed. Okay, so your savings account isn't overflowing with cash. Monthly savings add up. You may not be very pleased with your current performance; your savings are likely still rather modest. But you may rest assured that the course you're on is the correct one. Continue in this manner, and in a few months or years, you will see significant progress.\n\nIf you're feeling sad because it seems like you're not making much progress, remind yourself that you are, in fact, taking the appropriate steps. But the question is: how can you set yourself on the proper course? Building good routines into your life is essential. As soon as this twitch ends, we'll get the details on their construction."

              "Upon entering a room that lacks illumination, the first thing most people do is frantically search for a light switch. The act of reaching for a light switch is ingrained behavior, something you do without thinking. Everything we do, from cleaning our teeth to operating a motor vehicle, is governed by such habits. The power they possess is staggering. But how do they originate?\n\nA psychologist named Edward Thorndike attempted to address this subject in the nineteenth century. He started by putting a few cats in a dark box. Then he timed how quickly they were able to get away. To begin, the cats' responses to being confined to a box were predictable. It tried to find a way out of the situation anxiously. It pawed at the walls and corners, giving them a good sniff. The cat would investigate the area and uncover a lever that, when pulled, would release a door. Thorndike re-ran the experiment with the cats that had previously escaped by putting them back in the box. Where did he turn up, exactly? Each cat eventually mastered the box after being placed in it several times. The cats didn't waste a minute or more stumbling around before going for the switch. The typical cat could break out in under a minute after twenty or thirty failed tries.\n\nIn other words, the cats had developed a routine for exiting the box. Thorndike's experiment revealed an essential principle: people are more likely to automatically engage in activities that lead to positive outcomes (in this case, increased independence) if they are rewarded for doing so. We now know far more than we did decades after Thorndike's experiment was conducted. Four components make up habits, as we have learned.\n\nThe initial step is the prompt, or impetus to take some form of action. Your brain automatically prepares you to take action to restore vision when you enter a dark room.\n\nThen, a want to transition from darkness to light sets in. A subsequent reaction or action follows, such as turning on a light.\n\nThe reward is the final stage because it is the ultimate goal of any habit. When one regains some visibility, a sense of moderate relief and contentment often follows. The same pattern applies to forming any habit. How often do you have your first cup of coffee in the morning? The act of waking up signals the beginning of an urge to be mentally sharp. Upon realizing this, you force yourself out of bed and into the kitchen in search of some caffeine. As a result, you'll feel more alert and prepared to take on the day. Now that you understand the mechanics of habit formation, we can examine the steps necessary to create the kinds of positive routines that can transform your life."

            "text": [
              "We now know how habits form. Summarize. A habit has four parts: a cue (a trigger), a craving (a want you wish to satisfy), a response (the habit itself), and a reward (the pleasurable feeling you get from completing the habit). Knowing how they work, you can hack the habit-forming process to develop excellent, productive habits. Let's say you're desperate to learn guitar. You've got your instrument and the basics, but you can't practice. You tell yourself you'll play later every morning, but by nightfall, you haven't touched your guitar.\n\nNow that you know how to form habits, you can benefit from them. Here, you want to make the guitar pick-up obvious. Leave your instrument in the middle of your living room instead of hiding it in a cabinet or spare room. Make your cue obvious to make practicing a habit. Implementation goals might improve triggers even more than changing your environment to highlight your cues. These? Most of us are too ambiguous about healthy practices. We say, \"I'll eat healthier\" or \"I'll learn guitar.\" We hope we'll finish. Implementation intentions help us move beyond ambiguous intentions. Implementation intentions help you arrange when and where to practice your habit.\n\nOK, back to our guitar example. Instead of saying \"you'll practice guitar sometime this week,\" say \"On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, when the alarm goes off, the first thing I'll do is take up my guitar and practice for one hour.\" Leave your instrument in the middle of the room. By formulating an implementation objective, you'll provide yourself a clear plan and an evident clue, making it easier to form a positive habit. Let's stop exploring for a moment. So, does it work? It sounds plausible. Can I change my environment to make beneficial behaviors easy? Sounds fantastic on paper, right? In practice?\n\nTo answer the topic, let's look at the work of Boston doctor Anne Thorndike, who is not related to cat lover Edward Thorndike. Dr. Anne Thorndike, like most health professionals, wants to help her patients eat better and snack less. But she also realized that eating healthier is challenging. Willpower and discipline are needed, and not everyone has them. So Anne Thorndike and her team created a test. As part of the project, she reconfigured the hospital cafeteria. The soda in the refrigerators next to the cash registers was replaced with bottled water, and baskets of water were put around the restaurant. After that, Dr. Thorndike and the team watched. What's your take? Well, over three months, soda sales plummeted 11% while water sales rose 25%. Dr. Thorndike and her team were able to encourage people to drink water by providing more cues. In other words, they helped people form better behaviors without pushing them to do so. Evidence that changing your environment can improve your behaviour.\n\nAtomic Habits is halfway through. We've discussed how powerful habits are, how they're formed, and how to employ habit cues. Now we'll discuss habit building rewards. James Olds and Peter Milner investigated desire's neurology in 1954. They blocked dopamine release in rats using electrodes. The lab rats simply gave up. They didn't want to eat, drink, breed, or do anything without dopamine. After a few days, they all died of thirst.\n\nThis disturbing incident shows us that dopamine motivates. We feel happy when we eat, drink, or have sex because dopamine is released. We repeat helpful actions because of this enjoyment. It's clear. What's the connection to habit-building? We don't have to do the joyful action to acquire dopamine. Dopamine is released only by thinking about something fun. The brain's reward system rewards wanting and getting!\n\nThis works to our benefit. We'll be more inclined to stick to our new habit if we enjoy it. Here's where I'll explain temptation bundling. Temptation bundling is linking a vital but unattractive activity to one you like. This is how to use dopamine to form a new habit. Take Ronan Byrne, an Irish engineering student. Ronan knew he should exercise more, but he didn't like it. However, he enjoyed Netflix. Ronan modified a stationary bike. He attached his bike to his laptop and built programming to only run Netflix at a specified speed. He made exercise enjoyable by tying it to a behavior he naturally liked.\n\nYou don't need to build a Netflix/exercise bike contraption to use this. It's simpler. For instance, you may read magazines at the gym to keep up on A-list gossip while working out. If you're making sales calls but want to watch sports, give yourself a half-hour of ESPN after your tenth prospect. Find a method to enjoy those unpleasant but necessary actions, and you'll ride a wave of dopamine and form good habits."

              "Adding pleasure to a routine increases the likelihood that it will be maintained. Another technique to circumvent natural barriers to habit formation is to remove unnecessary friction. It's easy to see how these habits have come to rule our daily lives. Because it's simple to do so, we waste time on social media or eat an entire bag of chips. However, doing a hundred push-ups or learning Mandarin are both very challenging and time-consuming activities. Because of this, we don't enjoy doing things like working out or learning a new language in our leisure time. When we reduce the cognitive load associated with doing the actions we want, we increase the likelihood that we will adopt them as habits. The good news is that there are several paths we can take to accomplish this. The first is to take measures to lessen friction. What does it mean? As far back as he can remember, James Clear has been completely incapable of sending out greeting cards. However, his wife never misses an opportunity to send a greeting card. Furthermore, there is a logical explanation for this. She has an assortment of greeting cards in her house, all neatly arranged in boxes. When you put in just a little amount of effort up front, it's much simpler to convey condolences, congrats, or anything else may be appropriate. There is less of a barrier to her sending congratulations on a marriage or a new job because she doesn't have to go out and buy a card. Friction occurs in both directions. You can raise friction to end a bad habit, or decrease it to transform a good behavior into a habit. As a result, if you want to squander less time in front of the TV, you should turn it off and remove the batteries from the remote. This amount of resistance is just right for making you limit your viewing to times when you're truly invested in it. To put it another way: nthat's friction. The second strategy is the two-minute rule, which uses time constraints to help establish a routine. This method can be used to make any challenging endeavor seem less so. The basic idea is that any action may be simplified into a habit that can be performed in under two minutes. Don't limit yourself to reading just one book a week if you want to read more. Try reading only two pages before bed instead. Or, if you're training for a marathon, make a point of putting on your running shoes and clothes every day when you get home from work. The two-minute rule is a practical method for developing routines that are within anyone's reach. After lacing up your sneakers, you'll most likely go for a run. You'll probably keep reading after the first two pages. The initial and crucial step in accomplishing anything is to simply begin."

              "We're almost done. Before we finish, let's discuss the last habit-improvement rule. We need a tale. Stephen Luby was a successful public health researcher. Luby was an effective worker in a Karachi area in the 1990s. He cut child diarrhea by 52%. He reduced pneumonia by 48% and skin infection by 35%. His secret? Good soap. Nice soap led to Luby's public health successes. Handwashing and basic sanitation reduced sickness, according to Luby. Locals knew this. But they weren't practicing.\n\nLuby and Proctor & Gamble gave the community free quality soap, which altered everything. Handwashing became fun overnight. New soap lathered well and smelled great. Washing hands became fun, so everyone did it. Stephen Luby's story shows the final and most essential behavioral transformation rule: habits must be rewarding.\n\nSatisfying excellent behavior is hard. Human evolution caused this. A delayed-return environment exists today. You work today but don't get paid until the end of the month. Morning gym visits don't result in weight loss. Unfortunately, our brains developed for immediate return. Our forefathers didn't consider retirement savings or diets. They worried about eating, sheltering, and avoiding saber-toothed tigers.\n\nThis concentration on fast gains can promote undesirable habits. Smoking improves stress and nicotine cravings, but it causes lung cancer in 20 years. Smoking may be worth the short-term health risks. This means you should aim to tie immediate enjoyment to habits with a delayed payoff. Using a couple the author knows well explains this. This couple wanted to eat out less, cook more, get healthier, and save money. Deferred goals. They started a \"Trip to Europe\" savings account to accelerate their goals. They deposited $50 every time they skipped a meal. The immediate delight of seeing $50 in their savings account kept them on pace for the ultimate prize."

Many successful persons have kept habits records. Franklin is famous. Franklin recorded 13 personal virtues in a notebook from 20. Avoiding idle chatter and being productive were among these virtues.\n\nFranklin tracked his progress each night. Franklin used a basic calendar or diary to chronicle his habits. Habit tracking is enjoyable and effective. Crossing off each day will boost your mood and motivation. Next, create a habit contract with penalties for deviating.\n\nNashville entrepreneur Bryan Harris took his habit contract seriously. He, his wife, and his trainer signed a pact to lose 200 pounds. He chose habits to get him there. These included daily meal tracking and weekly weighing. He then imposed sanctions. He was afraid of losing money and losing face in front of two people he cared about, so he tracked his food intake and weighed himself. We're sociable animals. Knowing others are watching can motivate us to succeed. How about a habit contract?\n\nEven if it's not as thorough as Bryan Harris's, pledge to your partner, best friend, or coworker. You'll stick to your behaviors if you agree on repercussions for not following through. As we've shown, maintaining a positive habit, no matter how minor, is the key to success."

              "These key ideas will follow a strange collection of people: A despondent entrepreneur, a disappointed artist, and a billionaire who wants to pass on his life lessons. The three met at a personal optimization conference where the Spellbinder, a legendary business expert known for his wizardry and insight, spoke. After the Spellbinder's lecture, the millionaire approached the entrepreneur and artist without them knowing. To remind himself that money isn't everything, the billionaire dressed as a beggar. Only his costly watch revealed his affluence. The destitute billionaire told the two that he had acquired a fortune thanks to the Spellbinder, who had taught him that while many people pray remarkable things will happen to them, genuinely elite performers realize that they can make extraordinary things happen themselves.\n\nThis intriguing individual who talked like a guru intrigued the entrepreneur and artist. The billionaire told them how the Spellbinder—his mentor—had taught him the most crucial thing. What? That a world-class morning routine is the best method to achieve personal and professional success. The billionaire generously offered. He would teach the entrepreneur and artist a world-class morning ritual at his Mauritius beach property. Meet at 5:00 a.m. The next morning, a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce took the entrepreneur and artist to a hanger with a sleek, ivory-colored private airplane with the logo \"5AC.\" The chauffeur told the entrepreneur the emblem signified \"The 5 AM Club.\" Thus began their discovery of a revolutionary morning ritual and a new life philosophy that may change everything. The next morning, the billionaire informed the entrepreneur and artist how he learnt to rise at 5:00 a.m. to accomplish greatness. Getting up at 5:00 a.m. increased his creativity, vitality, and productivity. How? The millionaire informed them that many greats, from John Grisham to Mozart, have realized that getting up at 5:00 a.m. multiplies isolation.\n\nAll humans have limited cognitive bandwidth. Work, the news, social media, and others consume our attention throughout the day. By noon, these fill up our bandwidth, so we can't focus. We neglect everything by switching our attention. If you wake up around 5:00 a.m., you can focus on one important task without distraction. Transient hypofrontality helps you achieve flow in your mind at 5:00 a.m. The millionaire stated that during a tranquil 5:00 a.m. start, the brain's prefrontal cortex, which controls rational thought, temporarily shuts off. Thus, you worry less and analyze less.\n\nThe serenity of daybreak increases dopamine and serotonin production. Result? You naturally flow—energized, focused, and in the zone. All best performers, from violinists to scientists, are in flow. If you wake up around 5:00 a.m., you'll be more productive all day. Another incentive to join the 5 AM club is that to get the outcomes of the top 5% of outstanding achievers, you must do what 95% of entrepreneurs, artists, and others are hesitant to do. If you can get up at 5:00 a.m., you have a big advantage over most others. Let's look at how to make history and influence the world."

              "The businessman, the artist, and the billionaire met on a beautiful morning in Mauritius. Squirrelfish swam together in a school through the pristine ocean. The billionaire retold the four main concerns of the major historical figures in this picturesque environment. First, he added, greatness is measured not by innate ability but by the amount to which one makes the most of one's opportunities. The billionaire believes that hard work and determination are more important than natural ability. Instead of doubting your abilities, focus on how you can best use your strengths.\n\nThe billionaire went on to say that, secondly, the absence of interruptions is crucial. People nowadays spend far too much time on useless technologies like social networking and video games. The key to victory is to zero down on the essentials and keep things as straightforward as possible. That requires you to become a purist, focusing on a small number of truly exceptional projects rather than a large number of merely satisfactory ones. In practical terms, this means eliminating any and all potential sources of distraction so that you can zero in on what really matters. As a result, you should disable alerts and postpone meetings that aren't productive.\n\nIf you join the 5 AM club, you'll have an extra hour every day to do the things that matter most to you without any interruptions. The third secret of success is that the best use day-stacking to their advantage. Which means that the little things you perform every day are far more valuable than the huge ones you do occasionally. Think about improving a single skill by 1% per day.\n\nFinally, the billionaire revealed the final priority of history-makers: personal mastery practice. Anders Ericsson, a psychologist, claims that in order to show symptoms of elite-level expertise, one must devote at least 2.75 hours each day to practice a skill for a full decade. Spend the first hour of every day honing in on yourself, your mindset, and your attitude to health, spirituality, and love if you truly want to become your own master. The billionaire stated it was time for the business owner and the artist to take things to the next level: it was time for them to learn how to foster their best selves."

              "The billionaire then remarked, \"How often have you heard an expert speak about enhancing your mindset?\" Positive thinking is a proven method for bettering one's life, as we are often reminded. A billionaire was walking with his students on a beach of white sand when he said, \"What these gurus don't tell you is that your Mindset is simply one of four \"internal empires.\"\n\nYou can't improve your Healthset, Heartset, and Soulset without also focusing on your Mindset. What a difference it would make if the entire picture was polished, instead of just 25%! Your Heartset is the state of your emotional health. Even if you have a top-notch Mindset, it won't get you very far if your emotional life is in shambles. \"Unexpressed emotions will never die,\" Sigmund Freud said. They are being buried alive, only to resurface at a later date in more heinous forms. Keeping a positive Heartset as a primary goal will yield positive results. Take care of your body next by focusing on your Healthset.\n\nLiving a long life is one of the best strategies to succeed. The billionaire quipped that if you were dead, you couldn't be an industrial titan. Investing in your health and fitness can provide you a few more years of peak performance and longevity, during which you can leave a more meaningful mark on the world. More than that, world-class athletes know that exercise improves the quality of life in every aspect. It revs you up, eases your mind, and fills you with more happiness. But that isn't all there is to it, since there's also an internal empire to develop.\n\nThe billionaire defined \"Soulset\" as one's \"spirituality.\" Everyday existence has a way of gravitating us toward the ephemeral and material. Therefore, use the early morning's peace and solitude to reflect on your true nature. Recognize and connect with your inner hero. Think about your unique contributions to society as dawn breaks. Spend some time thinking about your Soulset, and you'll get in touch with the best version of yourself. The business owner couldn't believe his ears. She gushed to the billionaire about how this new lens completely altered her sense of herself. But she was still curious. She wanted to know how she might best put her new knowledge to use during the morning rush. The billionaire said he would explain the 20/20/20 formula to her now, but not in Mauritius. In fact, they'd have to give up the ocean's pristine blue hues. Rome, \"The Eternal City,\" was their destination. It was time to take in the beauty of Rome's landmarks and indulge in some of the city's delicious cuisine to get in the Roman spirit."

It's time, the billionaire urged, to discover the secrets to radically improving your life in every measurable way. Getting up at 5 a.m. on its own isn't enough.\n\nThe optimal start to the day is not at 5:00 a.m., when you waste an hour mindlessly scrolling through social media and checking messages. The 20/20/20 rule will do the trick: 20 minutes of exercise, 20 minutes of thought, and 20 minutes of development. First, get up and going; do some serious cardio for 20 minutes. Actually exerting yourself to the point of sweating is what counts. The fear hormone cortisol is flushed out through sweating. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is produced during perspiration and is responsible for repairing damaged brain cells and speeding up the development of new neural connections. If you work up a sweat for 20 minutes, you will practically increase your mental speed. Next, set aside the early morning hours of 5:20-5:40 in order to have some quiet time to yourself and think.\n\nThink on what you value most in life before the day's complexities begin to appear. When you take a few moments to yourself in this age of distraction, when your phone stops pinging and your inbox stops filling, you might be surprised by the ideas, thoughts, and inspiration that come to you. Jot down these reflections in a diary. Write down your present goals, your gratitudes, and your grievances. You'll gain clarity on your goals and be able to release toxic, negative energy if you do this. Spend some time in quiet reflection. Meditation has been shown to reduce cortisol levels, which in turn reduces stress. It's a tried and true method for maintaining composure; after all, the world's greatest performers never lose their composure.\n\nIn the next 20 minutes, you'll finish off the first hour. Developing your skills is essential here; set up 20 minutes to study. Learn from the successes and failures of historical figures by reading their biographies. Study the ins and outs of the human mind. Listen to books on creating a business or watch films about new ideas. Every single billionaire I know has a passion for education. nTherefore, there you have it. This is the ideal regimen to adopt if you want to join the exclusive 5 AM club and make the most of your day."

              "As Rome awoke, the billionaire , the entrepreneur, and artist explored its depths. As they descended into the gloom, the billionaire proclaimed that they had arrived at the catacombs, the old Roman crypts beneath the city. When the artist inquired as to their purpose, the billionaire stated that, since they were surrounded by people who appeared to be asleep for eons, it was an ideal setting to talk about the significance of getting enough shut-eye.\n\nThe amount of sleep one gets is a major impact in determining longevity, according to studies. What you do in the last hour of the day is almost as crucial to reaching optimum performance as what you do in the first hour. Many people today suffer from sleep deprivation because of the prevalence of technological devices in daily life. Recent studies have shown that the blue light from our electronic gadgets can suppress production of melatonin. You won't be able to get a good night's rest if you keep staring at a screen right before bed, so make sure to put away your devices by 8 o'clock.\n\nGet some quality time in with friends and family, meditate, soak in the tub, or read before turning in at 10:00 p.m. By doing so, you'll be able to make the most of the hours before work begin. A good night's sleep isn't the only method to recharge your batteries. In fact, the secret to sustained peak performance is to alternate between intense bursts of labor and deep replenishment through rest, recuperation, and enjoyment. The billionaire refers to this as the \"twin-cycle of top performance.\" Growth occurs both during the \"performing\" phase and the \"recovery\" phase.\n\nThe billionaire explained that one should consult a farmer in order to get the reasoning behind this. He will inform you that before each harvest there is always a time of severe effort, including tilling the soil, planting seeds, and harvesting the crop. After that, though, comes the dormant period. In appearance, the fallow season is a time of dormancy. There appears to be no progress being made. The true predictor of how well crops will flourish is the fallow season, when the earth rests and replenishes its nutrients. The rest phase of the twin-cycle is something that not everyone is willing to fully embrace.\n\nThe business owner acknowledged this, revealing that she experiences feelings of guilt whenever she takes time away from her work. The billionaire countered that harmony must be maintained at all costs. Thus, don't merely toil. Relax and have fun, knowing that doing so is an integral component of reaching your full athletic potential."

          "First, we'll share a story, and then we'll go on to the renowned economic takeaways. A kid named Robert Kiyosaki tells his story. The story opens in the 1950s. Both Robert and his childhood pal Mike were inquisitive kids with lofty goals: they planned to become extremely wealthy adults. But they weren't sure how they were going to get there. The youngsters sought guidance after their initial attempt to mint coins from melted toothpaste tubes ended in failure. They inquired of their fathers the best means by which to acquire wealth. You may probably predict what Robert's own well-educated but \"poor dad\" said in response: \"Go to school, study, and find a nice job.\"\n\nIt's common wisdom, but it's not very well thought out. If you adopt this advice, you'll spend your entire life slaving away for more money, while the government, creditors, and your superiors siphon off the bulk of your earnings.\n\nThe advice his impoverished father gave Robert was essentially the same as telling him to \"Join the rat race,\" the never-ending pattern of working for everyone but yourself. Many individuals today still adhere to poor dad's slogan, but they do so out of fear, an overwhelming sensation of discomfort at the prospect of going against the norms that our society instills in us. We're told that getting a decent job is the key to financial success, so we put in long hours at school and then again as adults. In what way?\n\nWe're not exactly sinking into poverty, but neither are we swimming in riches. But there are parents out there who know better and who don't instill that belief in their children: they're the ones who understand the process by which wealth is generated and sustained. That is to say, wealthy people, such as Mike's father, who served as a financial role model and mentor to his sons. So, what did Mike's dad recommend? Zero initial activity. He negotiated a bargain with young Kiyosaki, telling him that he would teach him everything he knew about money in exchange for his labor at the low rate of 10 cents per hour. Robert agreed, but after a couple of weeks of working for less than minimum wage, the young man went back to his \"wealthy\" father fuming and ready to resign. He finally exploded, saying, \"You've used me for long enough, and you haven't even honored your promise. In all those weeks, you didn't teach me a thing about personal finance.\"\n\nHis new teacher gave him his first lesson with a smile on his face. Life, as Robert Kiyosaki had recently discovered, has a tendency of pushing you around. And he knew now that a job doesn't guarantee financial success. Therefore, affluent people don't need to work for their wealth. You may be wondering how the wealthy become so prosperous if they choose not to work for it. Perhaps by means of thievery or a lucky lottery ticket?"

        "text": [
          "Let's address that fundamental question posed by the previous concept: None of the aforementioned is correct. Making their money work for them is how the wealthy get rich. They save or put away a portion of their money rather than squander it on unnecessary goods. They let their assets generate income for them rather than working for it themselves. Let's not get ahead of ourselves, though; last we saw, Robert was still a young boy for whom \"asset\" was an unfamiliar word.\n\nHowever, Mike's wealthy father was about to alter that. One day he took the lads down and explained to them how the rich invest in assets while the poor invest in liabilities, frequently thinking they are doing the former. He clarified that everything that increases one's financial standing is considered an asset. Money-losing activities are known as liabilities. This nuance is crucial, but few people get it properly.\n\nLet's have a look at an illustration. It's common knowledge that a home represents a valuable asset. However, it is one of the greatest weaknesses a person may have. Paying for a 30-year mortgage and annual property taxes takes a significant financial toll on most people who decide to become homeowners. Mortgage-financed home purchases are counterproductive in two ways: There's a clear liability here since, first, it's going to take a huge chunk out of your monthly income over the following 360 months. Second, you could have invested those $360 over the course of a year in something that would have returned a far higher rate of return, so boosting your personal wealth. \"If you want to be rich, all you have to do is recognize actual assets and buy them,\" Rich Dad explained to his two sons as plainly as he could. But if you spend your whole life amassing debt, you'll never amount to anything.\n\nA poor person's income is quickly consumed by necessities like rent, taxes, and food, as illustrated by Rich Dad. The income of a middle class person must cover not only these costs, but also debts such as a mortgage, student loans, credit cards, and auto loans. But the wealthy? They are self-sufficient and don't require a paycheck since their assets (such as stocks, bonds, or real estate you rent to tenants) generate enough income to cover their expenses and give them a surplus to reinvest. Because of this reinvestment, their income increases once more, ensuring that the wealthy continue to amass wealth. nI feel it's necessary to emphasize this point once more: reducing your debt and living expenditures will free up capital that can be put to use in assets. If you follow those steps, you will quickly find yourself with a tidy sum of money."

          "You might want to raise an objection now. It's simple to tell people to get out of their \"rat-race\" occupations and start their own businesses, but if they can't find work, they won't be able to save up for such assets anyway. Was it always supposed to just magically materialize? Nope. Don't worry, you haven't received any pressure to give up your day job just yet. However, in his third lesson, Kiyosaki emphasizes the value of \"minding your own business.\"\n\nNow, that doesn't imply you shouldn't pry into the affairs of others, at least not in this case. In other words, you should prioritize your own financial well-being and work to increase your income rather than only that of your company. To put it another way, if you want to get ahead in life, you need to stop worrying about what others think and start producing money off of your own assets. However, there is a distinction between your occupation and your business when it comes to your personal finances: Whatever you do for a livelihood, whether it's a full-time job or a side gig, 40 hours a week, is your occupation. A job title like \"restaurant owner\" or \"sales manager\" is one common result.\n\nHowever, you put your time and money into your business in order to increase your wealth. How does this relate to Robert's efforts to improve his financial situation? His impoverished old dad told him when he was young to prioritize getting a good job that would provide for him and his family. However, his affluent father encouraged him to begin investing early on. Can you guess whose recommendation he followed?\n\nYes, I'm talking about Rich Dad's. At the tender age of nine, Robert started his first business: renting out comic books to the local kids in exchange for money from his friend's sister. Others did the labor, while he merely pocketed the profits. Later in life, he also held a regular job. In truth, he worked long hours for major corporations like Xerox and Standard Oil of California, but he managed to accumulate a sizable nest egg by keeping his overhead low, avoiding unnecessary debt, and putting his money to work in the form of investments.\n\nThis is how Kiyosaki realized he needed to stop worrying about what other people thought of him. It's true that he worked for a living, but his wealth came from the appreciation of his possessions. His experience working for others and investing their money led him to view his assets as his own personal workforce; he knew that every dollar he invested would be producing income for him even while he slept. It's enticing to hear, wouldn't you say? And if you share my desire to amass wealth, then you had better think along the same lines. Even with raises and bonuses, your pay probably won't be enough to make you rich. A wage can serve as a down payment on the wealth-creating assets you so much need. The takeaway? You'll never become rich doing both your job and your business, so you'd better learn the difference. I won't say which one because you already know."

He felt the narrative was intriguing, but his affluent dad disagreed. Robin Hood appeared shady to him. Rich dad believed Robin Hood inspired the tax structure he hated. Like Robin Hood, the government tried to take from the rich and give to the poor.\n\nHowever, rich dad explained, they failed. Rich dad believed that the middle class bore the tax burden. Rich people used sophisticated techniques to avoid taxes. Corporations help the wealthy avoid taxes. After all, a corporation is only taxed on what remains after spending pre-tax dollars. However, individuals are taxed first before spending the rest. Important differentiation.\n\nImagine being taxed on the portion of your salary you didn't spend! Rich people can dodge taxes by forming businesses to hide their holdings. Corporations provide rich people more than that. Corporations restrict your losses if your business fails. If you default on a debt, you must sell your goods, declare bankruptcy, and follow the law. But what happens if a firm fails and can't pay its creditors? But the owners only lose their investment. Nobody steals their stuff. Nobody reclaims their homes. Corporations give the wealthiest great financial gains without matching dangers. So what's the lesson?

          "Let's resume Robert Kiyosaki's story. Rich Dad allowed Robert and Mike full access to his business dealings while they were young. They observed his meetings with bankers, attorneys, and accountants to learn about business ownership. Thus, the boys learnt a lot rapidly, but they soon ran into issues. Because of their rich dad's skills, they didn't take education seriously.\n\nThey were often informed that hard work and education lead to success and money, but only rich dad seemed to think financial literacy was crucial. Children aren't taught about saving or investing, so they don't understand compound interest. Today, high kids max up their credit cards. Today's children and highly educated adults, many of whom make terrible financial judgments, lack financial intelligence training. Most people have no retirement plan. 50% of US workers lack pensions. 75–80% have ineffective pensions. Obviously, society has left us financially illiterate. Kiyosaki emphasizes financial literacy. Now what? Learn! Start a financial plan.\n\nYou can start building wealth at any age, but the sooner the better. Naturally, starting at 20 is more likely to make you rich than starting at 30. But regardless of your age, the easiest way to get started is by following these three steps. Assess your money. Set goals. Third, get educated. Let's examine each: First, assess your finances. What income and expenses can you reasonably expect from your current job? Your dream Mercedes may not be affordable right now. Be truthful!\n\nDon't consider unobtainable funds. Set achievable financial objectives afterward. You may desire that Mercedes in five years. Kim Kiyosaki bought her Mercedes after four years using apartment development earnings. Next, establish your financial intelligence. This is an investment in your greatest asset: your mind. Manage money. If you're terrified of rejection, try a brief stint in network marketing. Despite a low compensation, you'll learn sales skills and self-confidence that will benefit you later. You can also study finance in your free time. Attend finance seminars, study books, and network with professionals. Do you understand? Again: examine your financial condition, make goals, and then build financial intelligence to achieve them. These foundations can help you grow wealthy and one day park that Mercedes in your garage."

        "text": [
          "This essential principle examines your financial mentality. Because if you want to improve your finances, you must change your financial habits. Learn to take risks. The brave succeed in real life, not the smart. Rich people have chutzpah, courage, or audacity—the ability to take risks.\n\nWhy? If you don't overcome fear, you'll miss tremendous life opportunities. The studious and clever suffer financially because they fear society's censure and can't leave the \"rat race\" and become affluent. Their fear of losing money inhibits them from investing. They forget that success requires courage. Financial intelligence is knowledge and fortitude. These two things distinguish the rich.\n\nLesson 5. Financial intelligence lets the rich \"create\" money in any situation. They recognize opportunities, respond appropriately, and have the courage to act. From the outside, they appear lucky, but they create their own luck. Robert and Mike learned something in affluent dad's business meetings that school couldn't. Real-world success requires courage, not just hard effort. Courage and financial understanding allow you to swiftly detect and capitalize on possibilities. You can nearly \"create\" money.\n\nLet's examine risk in this essential idea. Meaning? First, putting money in basic bank checking and savings accounts involves accepting risks. Instead of being safe, invest in stocks or bonds. These riskier bank accounts can generate substantially more wealth. Stocks can do this quickly. If you don't want to invest in stocks, there are other ways to build money. Property or tax lien certificates. Tax lien certificates have interest rates between 8 and 30 percent, compared to 0.21 percent for American savings accounts in 2013.\n\nRisk increases with return. For instance, stocks can lose all their value. But if you don't take the risk, you'll never generate huge returns. So taking higher risks and managing them is important to start producing more money. Rich dad would want it."

          "What we have learnt so far is that you should put your money to work for you, that financial knowledge is important, and that taking risks can pay off. Even yet, there is one more thing you may take away from your affluent dad's wisdom. After finishing college, Robert had no trouble finding a permanent, well-paying work. For most individuals, including his educated but financially unstable father, this would have been a dream come true. Poor old dad knew that the best way to ensure his family's financial future was through a steady job and consistent effort, but we all knew that before. However, neither Robert nor the \"wealthy dad\" fit this description. In around six months, he decided to leave his job and enlist in the Marines to become a pilot. Both of his parents were confused, but his wealthy father was happy for him.\n\nWhy? Not because he condoned risky behavior, but rather because he knew exactly what Robert was up to. He wasn't looking for a consistent paycheck; he just wanted to get smarter. He wanted to find work that would teach him something worthwhile. nHis wealthy father had instilled in him the belief that knowledge of many different subjects was necessary for financial success. That's why Robert was eager to gain knowledge in addition to financial gain. After all, he had assets for a reason: to make money. Aw, poor old dad just didn't get it. Robert's actions, in his opinion, were counterproductive to success.\n\nYou see, he was a professor, a highly educated man with a doctorate degree. His life's journey had taught him that success required a narrow focus rather than a broad set of abilities and information. As one climbs the academic ladder and acquires more knowledge, the focus of their research naturally becomes more specialized. As soon as they finish medical school, many doctors can't wait to narrow their focus to either orthopedics or pediatrics. For some, focusing their efforts in one area might yield tangible benefits. Though, unfortunately, poor dad's PhD did little to increase his earnings, so it wasn't much assistance.\n\nWhile rich dad knew a lot of stuff, he only went up to the eighth grade. This is why he had Robert and Mike, two of his young employees, shadow employees from all around his vast organization. They've had jobs in hospitality, building, retail, advertising, accounting, and more. It wasn't so much about helping students zero in on a specific professional path as it was about giving them a wide set of tools to succeed in whatever economic climate. Therefore, the sixth and last lesson is: Work not merely to earn, but also to learn."

          "Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki is a life-changing book that teaches us about the importance of financial education, the power of creating passive income streams, and the mindset necessary to build wealth.\n\nThe book follows Kiyosaki's life journey, where he shares his experiences with two fathers, his own \"poor dad\" and his friend's \"rich dad\". He highlights how the difference in their financial perspectives and practices shaped his own understanding of money.\n\nKiyosaki's teachings in the book offer a new way of thinking about money, challenging the traditional approach to financial management. He believes that financial freedom is not about earning more money but is instead about understanding how money works and making it work for us.\n\nHere are ten actions we can take to implement the learnings from the book into our own lives:\n\n1.\n\nInvest in financial education: Educate ourselves on how money works and learn financial management skills.\n\n2.\n\nDevelop multiple streams of income: Create passive income streams through investments or entrepreneurial ventures.\n\n3.\n\nFocus on assets, not liabilities: Prioritize purchasing assets that generate income rather than liabilities that drain our finances.\n\n4.\n\nPractice delayed gratification: Delay short-term pleasures to enjoy long-term financial success.\n\n5.\n\nEmbrace failure: View failures as opportunities for growth and learning.\n\n6.\n\nBuild a strong mindset: Cultivate a mindset of abundance, take calculated risks, and believe in our abilities.\n\n7.\n\nNetwork with successful people: Surround ourselves with people who have achieved financial success and learn from them.\n\n8.\n\nUse debt to our advantage: Use debt to finance assets that generate income instead of using it for consumption.\n\n9.\n\nStay disciplined: Stay committed to our financial goals and consistently work towards achieving them.\n\n10.\n\nFocus on legacy: Create a financial plan that leaves a legacy for future generations to benefit from.\n\nBy implementing these actions in our lives, we can take control of our financial futures and build wealth that can provide us with a life of abundance. The lessons from Rich Dad, Poor Dad can inspire us to take action towards financial independence and create a life of freedom and prosperity."

          "In this section, the author discusses the workings of the brain and the impact of subconsciousness on our personality.\n\nHe regards the function of the brain as the control center and argues that the brain is responsible for creating our perceptions of reality. He writes that the way we think, feel, and act is largely determined by our subconscious beliefs and thought patterns.\n\nAccording to Dr. Dispenza, the brain operates in two modes: the default mode, where it runs automatically based on past experiences and learned behaviors, and the intentional mode, where we are consciously aware and able to direct our thoughts and actions.\n\nHe asserts that most people live their lives primarily in the default mode and that their conduct is driven by unconscious habits and faith. However, by becoming more aware of our thoughts and developing the ability to consciously direct our brain, we can change these habits and rewire our neural pathways to create a more intentional and fulfilling life.\n\nDr. Dispenza also explains the science behind the brain and its function, including the concepts of neuroplasticity and quantum physics, to provide a thorough knowledge of how the brain works and how we can use it to create positive change in our lives.\n\nNeuroplasticity describes the brain's ability to relink itself in response to new experiences. This research supports the idea that the mind can shape the brain and the body, and that individuals have the ability to actively change their neural pathways and thought patterns.\n\nDr. Joe Dispenza's perspective on quantum physics and the brain is that quantum physics provides a scientific explanation for the connection between the mind and the body. He asserts that the principles of quantum physics, such as non-locality, entanglement, and the observer effect, can be applied to the way the brain works and how thoughts and beliefs can impact physical health.\n\nAccording to  him, the observer effect, which states that the mere act of observation can influence the outcome of an event, demonstrates that consciousness can impact physical reality. He claims that this theory supports the idea that our thoughts and beliefs can influence our physical  well-being and that the brain and the mind are connected in a way that allows us to consciously shape our reality.\n\nIn addition, he also highlights the concept of non-locality, which states that particles can be connected in such a way that a change in one particle affects the other, even if they are separated by great distances. He reiterates that this concept applies to the brain and the body and that our thoughts and emotions can directly affect us physically.\n\nIn conclusion, Dr. Dispenza views quantum physics as a crucial piece of evidence for the link between the mind and the body and as a way to understand the power of our thoughts and beliefs to govern our reality.\n\nThe author  says that the majority of our thoughts and behaviors are influenced by our subconscious mind, and by accessing and reprogramming it, one can create a lasting change in their life. Through the use of meditation and mindfulness, the reader can learn to direct their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, and realize their capabilities.\n\nDr. Dispenza also shares evidence and case studies to demonstrate the power of the subconscious mind in  affecting our lives, as well as practical exercises and tools to help the reader gain greater control over their subconscious mind.\n\nSome studies Dr. Dispenza mentions are about the placebo effect, meditation and neuroplasticity.\n\nThe placebo effect study highlights the power of belief and how it can influence the body. It shows that the mind can have a substantial impact on physical health and wellness, even if the belief is not based on any scientific evidence.\n\nThe meditation study examines the effects of meditation on the brain and body. It suggests that regular meditation can change brain activity and even alter the physical structure of the brain, leading to improved mental and physical health.\n\nIn this essential segment, the author also touches on the concept of epigenetics, which refers to the study of how environmental factors can affect the expression of our genes. He explains how our environment, including our thoughts and emotions, can alter our genetic expression and impact our health and well-being.\n\nThrough the use of meditation, visualization, and affirmations, Dr. Dispenza encourages the readers to cultivate a new reality for themselves, one that is aligned with their deepest desires and aspirations. By rewiring the subconscious mind, the readers can  redirect their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors and create a life that is filled with happiness, success, and fulfillment.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Science of the Brain and the Subconscious Mind\" is a powerful and insightful exploration of  how the brain functions."

          "The second pivotal segment in Dr. Joe Dispenza's book is \"Changing Limiting Beliefs and Emotional Patterns\". In this section, the author focuses on the notion of limiting beliefs and how they hold us back from reaching our full potential. He mentions that our beliefs and emotional patterns are created by our experiences, environment, and upbringing, and that they can be reshaped through awareness and conscious effort.\n\nIn his view, restricting beliefs are negative thought patterns, or ideas, that we hold about ourselves and the world around us that limit our talent for growth and success. He argues that a restraining mindset can alter our experiences, health, and well-being and can prevent us from achieving our goals and living a fulfilling life. Its classic examples that one may experience in a day are : I'm not  good/smart enough, I'm not worthy of the compliments, love and respect, I wouldn’t be liked so much if they found out how I really am.\n\nOne study revealed that positive thoughts can lead to increased levels of serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins, which can lead to an improved sense of well-being.\n\nAnother powerful study shows that our feelings of self-worth are largely influenced by the stories we tell ourselves, and that if we can reframe them in more optimistic ways, we can boost our self-esteem.\n\nThe writer tells the tale of a woman who had been in a car accident and suffered from chronic back pain. She tried many treatments, but nothing seemed to help. She thought: “I will never get rid of this suffering and live a happy life again.” One day, she heard about a seminar that Dr. Dispenza was  organizing and decided to attend. During the seminar, Dr. Dispenza asked her to imagine her back ache disappearing. She was told to visualize what her life would look like, without all the suffering, in detail. She did, and the pain gradually faded away.\n\nThe author used this story to illustrate how our limiting beliefs can keep us from experiencing things that can help us heal. He further explained that when we start believing that we are incurable, we block ourselves from being open to the possibility of healing. In this case, once the lady let go of her inhibitions, she began to restore her health.\n\nIn this portion of the book, the writer encourages and empowers the reader to get hold of their beliefs and emotions, and reshape their lives by changing limiting beliefs and emotional patterns. Through clear explanations, real-life examples, and actionable steps, he guides the reader on a journey towards greater self-awareness, personal growth, and fulfillment."

          "The third key idea explored in \"Breaking The Habit of Being Yourself\" is \"Harnessing the Power of Mind through Meditation and Mindfulness\". In this part, the author explains how meditation and mindfulness practices can be used to use intellect and modify our lives for the best.\n\nDrawing on years of research and personal experience, Dr. Dispenza mentors the readers to make use of meditation and mindfulness to alter limiting beliefs and emotional patterns.\n\nThe author shares numerous narratives and case studies to demonstrate the power of meditation and mindfulness, and provides techniques to help the audience incorporate these practices into their daily lives. He also throws light on the advantageous effects of meditation practice including reduced stress, improved immune function, and increased feelings of happiness and well-being.\n\nDr. Dispenza tells an extraordinary anecdote of a monk who had been meditating for over 40 years. He had reached a point in his practice where he was able to control his heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. The monk was able to sit in an ice-cold river for hours without his body temperature changing. It shows the insane mental control over the body that can be reached by practicing intense meditation. The author writes another story of a man who, after years of struggle with anxiety, was able to meditate for long periods of time, and eventually, conquered his apprehensions. The man reached a state of mindfulness and clarity, where he could observe his thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them.\n\nThroughout the book, the author emphasizes the importance of mindfulness and meditation in transforming our lives and reaching our full potential. By channeling mind power through these practices, the reader can break free from limiting beliefs and emotional patterns and create a life filled with happiness, peace, and purpose.\n\nTo give you a glimpse into the power of meditation, we end this chapter with steps from Dr. Dispenza‘s meditations.\n\nBegin with a deep conscious breathing exercise to activate the intrinsic muscles from the anus to the top of your head. This process will help release pent up emotions, and allow you to enter a calm state of mind.\n\nFocus on a specific part of your body and its surrounding space. This exercise will help lower your brain waves and access your subconscious mind, activating the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for repairing tissues and other important functions.\n\nMerge with the quantum field, which is a black empty space filled with energy and vibrations, by disconnecting from your body. Becoming pure consciousness in this field will allow you to attain a higher level of understanding and experience magic moments.\n\nFeel elevated emotions and experience your ideal self by imagining and feeling gratitude. This will allow every cell in your body to work at its peak performance, improve your overall health, and bring your dream future to life.\n\nWhen you're ready, slowly open your eyes and resume your day, maintaining the same state of mind as during the meditation. Be aware of your thoughts and try to match your behavior with your ideal vision of yourself."

          "The fourth module in this book is \"Mind-Body Connection and Personal Transformation.\" In this portion, the author covers the relationship between the mind and the body and how it shapes our physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. He explains that our thoughts, beliefs, and emotions can create chemical reactions in the body, leading to disease and suffering.\n\nDr. Dispenza says that personal modification requires a shift in both the mind and the body. He stresses on the importance of integrating mind, body, and spirit to achieve optimal health and well-being. He provides tools to help the reader connect with their body and release negative thoughts, emotions, and patterns.\n\nThese practical techniques include:\n\nMeditation : The author emphasizes the significance of meditation as a way of calming the mind and accessing the subconscious. He teaches ways to practice meditation, including techniques of pacifying mind and focusing attention.\n\nVisualization :  He recommends readers to visualize the future they want to create, using imagination and emotion to bring the vision to life. This technique can help rearrange the subconscious mind and create new neural pathways that support positive change.\n\nAffirmations : He suggests using positive affirmations to reinforce new, empowering beliefs and counteract the limiting ones. He advocates repeating them several times a day, both out loud and in your mind.\n\nMovement and Exercise : He believes that movement and exercise can help create new neural pathways and promote physical, mental, and emotional well-being. He suggests incorporating regular physical activity into your routine.\n\nGratitude Practice : He highlights the importance of cultivating gratitude as a way to change the brain and increase feelings of well-being. He says to focus on what you're thankful for each day, either through journaling or mental visualization.\n\nMindful Awareness : He asks readers to be more present in each moment, and to observe thoughts and emotions without judgment. He endorses practices such as mindfulness meditation, deep breathing, and mindful movement to cultivate greater awareness and control over the mind.\n\nTo discuss the mind-body connection, Dr. Dispenza writes about a personal incident of his own accident and the incredible recovery afterwards:\n\nWhile he was cycling, a 55 mph four-wheel-drive Bronco slammed into him from behind during a turn at an intersection, causing him to fall hard and break six vertebrae in his spine. He suffered considerable damage, but Dr. Joe was lucky to have escaped with his life. Medical experts recommended the complicated Harrington rod surgery to realign his spinal cord, but Dr. Joe wasn't willing to accept the fact that the procedure would leave him disabled.\n\nSo what did he do? Instead of undergoing surgery, Dr. Joe spent a lot of time lying down, pondering. He saw it as an opportunity to make the most of his situation. He immersed himself in meditation and visualized his spine mending. And it did just that!\n\nThree months after his accident, Dr. Joe was back on his feet and training again. All the doctors had told him he would be in a full-body cast for a year and be unable to lead a normal life, but through the power of meditation, he proved them all wrong by healing his body with just his mind.\n\nThrough meditations, visualization, and other practices, the readers can learn to activate the mind-body connection and utilize the power of mind to heal and transform their lives."
